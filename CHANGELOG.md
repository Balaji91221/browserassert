# Changelog

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-13

Packaging and documentation release for the public `@kelavathbalajinaik/browserassert` npm package.
The scoped name avoids a registry naming conflict. SDK imports use the scoped
name; the `browserassert` CLI, exported APIs, and GitHub repository keep their names.
Updated npm installation instructions, package and lockfile versions, and
release guidance. The package continues to ship
compiled JavaScript and TypeScript declarations. No runtime behavior or
dependency versions changed; existing v0.2.0 GitHub tags and assets are preserved.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-13 (local)

Completed the local roadmap implementation, source-backed reports, bounded
integration paths, regression checks and package documentation. See
[FEATURE_MATRIX.md](FEATURE_MATRIX.md) for the exact features and test files.
Added MIT license and a CI workflow; no registry publication or remote CI execution
is implied. Model integrations were tested with controlled endpoints only.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-13

Initial runnable SDK/CLI slice and seeded examples.
